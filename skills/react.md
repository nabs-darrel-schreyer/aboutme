# React

Public samples that show front-end work with React and the modern TypeScript toolchain.

### [Containerisation](https://github.com/nabs-darrel-schreyer/Containerisation)

**Aspire publish that folds SPA + API into one container**

Containerisation is a .NET Aspire sample that keeps a React/Vite frontend and ASP.NET Core API as separate resources in development, then publishes them as a single container. The AppHost uses `PublishWithContainerFiles` to build the SPA into the server's `wwwroot`, so one image serves both UI and `/api`. A `publish.ps1` script prepares the Aspire Docker environment, saves the image as a tar, and runs it locally - useful for teams who want one deployable unit without a separate static host.

`.NET Aspire` | `ASP.NET Core` | `React` | `Vite` | `TypeScript` | `Docker` | `pnpm`
